    <lightning-card title="Debounce &#38; Throttle">
        <ui-lightning-card-p><b>Debounce</b> and <b>throttle</b> are two related (but not similar) techniques in JavaScript for optimization of resource-heavy tasks, usually ones that are trigerred by DOM events.</ui-lightning-card-p>
        <br />
        <ui-lightning-card-p>Both functions allow us to have control how many times a function will be called over time, and limit it to a level that fits our use case. This way, a resource-heavy function (for example an API call), will not be over-trigerred, which could cause our application to substantially slow down or even freeze.</ui-lightning-card-p>
        <br />
        <ui-lightning-card-p>For example, let's consider a use case of a function that's trigerred by a scroll event. Scroll the container below, and see how many scroll events are registered:</ui-lightning-card-p>
        <br />
        <ui-lightning-card-p>
            <div class="scroll-example">
                <div class="scroll-container" onscroll={scrollHandler}>
                    <div class="scroll-inner"></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="scroll-counter">{counterText}</div>
                    <div class="scroll-counter">{scrollPositionText}</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </ui-lightning-card-p>
        <br />
        <ui-lightning-card-p>Now imagine this scroll events call a API to update a table data. That's a lot of calls! Debounce and throttle are exactly for these use cases, where we probably don't need as many calls to our function as there are events.</ui-lightning-card-p>
        <br />
        <ui-lightning-card-p>We will now discuss each of the functions, what it does, and what is it used for. Before we move on though, here are some links that you might find useful!</ui-lightning-card-p>
